# Bootstrap registry (one per claims repo).
#
# Each item becomes an Argo CD Application that syncs the `bootstrap/` folder from the
# claims repo (typically containing a `Tenant` claim like `bootstrap/tenant.yaml`).
#
# The template repo also writes `bootstrap/team.yaml` (not a Kubernetes manifest), so the
# ApplicationSet excludes it.
#
# Example:
# - name: testing
#   repoURL: https://github.com/brams240287/Testing.git
#   targetRevision: main
#   path: bootstrap
#   destinationNamespace: platform-tenants
