# Claims registry (per claims repo + environment).
#
# Add entries here to onboard additional team/app claims repos without changing the
# Argo CD ApplicationSet.
#
# Each item becomes an Argo CD Application that syncs a single env folder (e.g. claims/dev)
# from the given repo into the target cluster.
#
# Notes:
# - `prune: true` is typical for dev/staging; `prune: false` is typical for prod.
# - `destinationNamespace` should match the claim manifests' `metadata.namespace`.
#
# Example:
# - name: testing
#   repoURL: https://github.com/brams240287/Testing.git
#   targetRevision: main
#   env: dev
#   path: claims/dev
#   destinationNamespace: team-backend
#   prune: true
